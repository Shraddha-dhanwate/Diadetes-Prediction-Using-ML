# **Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning**  

ðŸš€ **Overview**  
This project is part of an internship provided by Interpe, where I explored the use of machine learning techniques to predict diabetes. The goal was to analyze healthcare datasets to assist in early diagnosis, empowering proactive healthcare decisions.

## **Features**  
- ðŸ©º **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing healthcare data for accurate predictions.  
- ðŸ¤– **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM for prediction.  
- ðŸ“Š **Evaluation Metrics**: Model performance evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- ðŸ“ˆ **Visualization**: Insights into data and model results with charts and plots.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - Pandas, NumPy: Data processing  
  - Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms  
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn: Data visualization  
  - TensorFlow/Keras (optional): Neural network implementation  

## **Getting Started**  
### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.x  
- Install dependencies with:  
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```  

### Dataset  
- The project uses a public dataset (e.g., PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset). Download or place the dataset in the `/data` folder.  

### Run the Project  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git
   ```  
2. Navigate to the directory:  
   ```bash
   cd diabetes-prediction
   ```  
3. Execute the script:  
   ```bash
   python main.py

## **Results**    
- Visualizations showcase key data trends and feature importance.  
## **Future Scope**  
- Enhancing model accuracy with advanced algorithms.  
- Deploying the model as a web or mobile application.  
- Integrating real-time predictions using APIs.
